# ðŸ¥¬ Lettuce Growth Days Analysis â€“ Python Portfolio Project
> A hands-on Python project analyzing environmental factors affecting lettuce growth, using real-world agricultural data.

This repository demonstrates practical Python data analysis using a real-world dataset: the **Lettuce Growth Days** dataset sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). Originally designed for spreadsheet-based tasks as part of the Google Data Analytics Certificate, this project replicates and extends those objectives using Python. It includes a complete data pipelineâ€”from cleaning and transformation to statistical analysis and visualization.

## SMART Questions Addressed

This project explores five SMART (Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, Time-Bound) questions:

| SMART Element       | Example Question                                                                |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Specific**        | Is there a connection between humidity and temperature?                         |
| **Measurable**      | What is the average growth over one week?                                       |
| **Action-Oriented** | Does increasing TDS speed up the growth of lettuce?                             |
| **Relevant**        | Which environmental factors are most related to plant growth?                   |
| **Time-Bound**      | What is the time range covered in this dataset?                                 |

## What This Code Does

| Feature                | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **Data Cleaning**      | Handles inconsistent entries and removes irrelevant/redundant columns |
| **Descriptive Stats**  | Computes mean, median, min, max, and quartiles |
| **Feature Engineering**| Adds Fahrenheit temperature and Growth Weeks |
| **Correlation Analysis** | Measures and visualizes relationships between variables and plant growth |
| **Data Visualization** | Uses Matplotlib & Seaborn to create visual insights like heatmaps |
| **Exporting**          | Saves cleaned data and outputs for further use |
